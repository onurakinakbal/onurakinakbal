Currently, I have been doing bunch of stuff. Trying to learn new things, trying to catch up with uni and ofcourse trying not to loose my mind while trying to figure out what am I gonna do with my life after university and some existential thoughts and pains...

Just joking and fooling around though 😅😅 I hope you all doing well and not finding errors in your code. Mainly I create this account in order to exhibit my poorly written code trails and maybe but maybe develope them into something better (I hope they will be get better) and useful!
